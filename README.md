**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.

We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing 
multiple versions of node and npm.

## Installation

## Install npm packages

> See npm and nvm version notes above

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

**Attention Windows Developers:  You must run all of these commands in administrator mode**.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command first create a bundle for the application, 
then simultaneously open browser with `webpack-dev-server`.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

You're ready to write your application.

### npm scripts
